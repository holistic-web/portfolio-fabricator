# Cloud Functions

We currently have one cloud function to create an empty portfolio object when a user creates their account. It follows the documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/auth-events).

## Deploying Functions
Functions can be deployed by:
1. intalling dependencies in the `/functions` folder inside of this one
2. navigating back to this folder `/cloud-functions` and running `firebase deploy`

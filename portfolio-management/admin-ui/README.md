# admin-ui

This is the admin UI that allows a user to build a portfolio object to generate the site for the `[/fabricated-website]([/fabricated-website)` section of this project. It is written using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

## Getting Started
To get the project up and running:

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on the development machine
2. Open a terminal and change directory to this folder (`/portfolio-management/admin-ui/`)
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
4. Run `npm run serve` to host the project locally
5. If you want to build the project (to deploy it), run `npm run build` and follow the instructions displayed


## Hosting and Deployment
This is in early development and has not been initially deployed. 

This site is hosted on firebase project 'Portfolio Fabricator'. Raise an issue to gain access if you don't have it already.

To deploy the project:
1. Ensure the steps in 'Getting started' all complete succesfully
2. Run `npm run build` from this folder to generate the build
3. Run `firebase deploy` to update the live deployment with the generated build

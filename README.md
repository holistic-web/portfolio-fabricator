This is a tool to allow users to store their personal information (i.e. education, work experience) in a single location and easily export it to other sources.

## Architecture
- **Fabricated Website**: the project generating a user's website can be found in [/fabricated-website](/fabricated-website)
- **Portfolio**: the schema of a portfolio object can be found in [/portfolio.schema.json](/portfolio.schema.json)

## Developer Guidelines
- raise an issue for any new ideas, features, or bug reports
- to make changes create a pull request and submit it for review
- be sure to follow the code style guide defined in each project

## Roadmap
- administrative UI to define portfolio objects
- have a custom url display the generated website
- generate a pdf CV from the data provided
- import / export data from other sources, e.g. linkedIn
- allow users to receive messages from their website

# Portfolio Fabricator

This is a project to allow users to store their personal information (i.e. education, work experience) in a single location and easily export it to other sources. Along with that it also creates a website and can generate a CV from this information **[IN PROGRESS]**.

## Project Rules
- **Branch Protection Rules:** review requests are required to push to `master`
- **Code Style:** follow the .editorconfig and eslint rules provided, always imitate the code already in the project
- **Pull Requests:** clearly describe the work that is being done and why it's needed in the PR description
- **Issues:** after ensuring an issue doesn't already exist, raise one for any discussion point / improvement
